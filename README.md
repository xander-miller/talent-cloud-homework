*I have never attempted responsive design without a design framework before. I ran out of time to try and figure it out. I used flexbox to orient elements, I believe implementing responsive design would have been easier if I had built a grid system first. I have also never used relative element units (rem) before. I used it in this assignment because I noticed it used in the Talent Cloud portal. I also attempted to use BEM (Block Element Modifier) conventions from what I read over the weekend.*
